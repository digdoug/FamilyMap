# FamilyMap

An app I made during CS 240 (Advanced Progamming Concepts) at BYU in the Fall of 2016.

It displays about a millenium of genealogical data for an individual. This shows family relations and locations of significant life events.

I used Amazon maps API, recycler views, and almost every other widget under the sun.
